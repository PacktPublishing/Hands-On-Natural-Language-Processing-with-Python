**A practical guide to applying deep learning architectures to your NLP applications**

## What is this book about?
Natural language processing (NLP) has found its applications in various domains like web search, advertisements, customer service and with Deep Learning, we can bring high performance in these application areas. This book teaches you to leverage deep learning models in performing various NLP tasks; it also showcases the best practices in dealing with the NLP challenges.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Implement semantic embedding of words to classify and find entities
* Convert word to vectors by training to implement arithmetic on words 
* Train a deep learning model to detect classification of tweets, news
* Implement a question-answering model with search and RNN models
* Train models for various text classification datasets using CNN
